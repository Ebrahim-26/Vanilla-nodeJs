Here we are dealing with model and controller [usually we have a design system like MVC]

For 'view' we can use react

'models' - Models deals with data, here we are dealing with json files [strictly be used for CRUD]
'controller' - controller is going to controller wha the particular route is doing. like the status, header and what we are sending. 
                It is also doing to interact with the model.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------
When a req is made with certain end points, it calls the respective controller, then the controller calls in the data from the modal

server is dependent on controller,
controller is dependent on modal,
modal is dependent on the json (json for this project)
